            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;">Preety is a middle school student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with dyslexia.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;"> She as difficulty reading, but she enjoys her literature class.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;"> Her school started using online textbooks.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;"> She was initially worried about using this new format, but using text-to-speech software that
                highlights the text on the screen as it reads it aloud, she realized that she can focus on the content instead of stuggling
                over every word.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;"> The text-to-speech software helps with other online text; but, her experience with websites varies.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;"> Some sites use graphics in a way that helps her to focus on the content that she would like to read,
                while other sites have distracting advertisements and moving content.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;">She has problems with online content when the navigation is unclear, and prefers sites that have navigation
                cues including a navigation bar, search box, bread-crumb trails, and a sitemap.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;">Her school is using an acessible library catalog online.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;">Before it she had to go to the library to find books.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;">Now she can search the catalog using her phone, tablet, or laptop.</p>
            <p class="card-text" style="display:none;">She struggles with spelling but the search feature that suggests alternative spellings and correct words is helpful.</p>
